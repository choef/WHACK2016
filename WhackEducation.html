<h2>Understanding Revenge Porn</h2>
    <h3> <a href="https://www.cybercivilrights.org/faqs/">Revenge Porn: FAQ from Cyber Civil Rights</a> </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>What is revenge porn?</li>
          <p>Many perpetrators are not motivated by revenge or by any personal feelings toward the victim. A more accurate term is nonconsensual pornography, defined as the distribution of sexually graphic images of individuals without their consent. This includes both images originally obtained without consent as well as images consensually obtained within the context of an intimate relationship.</p>
        <li>What is the harm?</li>
          <p>Nonconsensual pornography can destroy victims’ intimate relationships, as well as their educational and employment opportunities. Victims are routinely threatened with sexual assault, stalked, harassed, fired from jobs, and forced to change schools. Some victims have committed suicide.</p>
        <li>Aren't victims protected by existing criminal laws?</li>
          <p>Many states’ voyeurism laws have not been updated to reflect current technology, so that they may not apply to images obtained by “upskirt photos” or hidden cameras. Even updated anti-voyeurism laws generally apply only to victims whose images were originally obtained without consent, not images consensually obtained for private use by an intimate partner.</p>


            <li>Aren't civil and copyright laws adequate to address this issue?</li>
          <p>Civil suits are costly, time-consuming, and often draw further attention to the offending material. Most suits stand little chance of success because so many defendants are judgment-proof – that is, they don’t have the financial resources to satisfy a judgment. In addition, many websites and social media sites are protected from civil liability by a federal law known as the Communications Decency Act §230, which provides immunity to online intermediaries for material posted by third-party users.</p>
        <li>Does criminalizing revenge porn violate the First Amendment?</li>
          <p>Nonconsensual pornography is, among other things, a violation of privacy. Criminal laws are often used to protect privacy, including criminal laws against unauthorized disclosures of private financial or medical information as well as laws against trespass and voyeurism. If criminal laws protecting financial, medical, and other forms of privacy can be compatible with the First Amendment, so can criminal laws protecting sexual privacy.</p>
        <li>Is putting people in jail for revenge porn too far?</li>
          <p>Nonconsensual pornography is a particularly destructive and serious invasion of privacy. Compared to many other types of conduct traditionally punished by criminal law, the harm it causes is often far more severe, lasting, and irremediable. Given the immediate, devastating, and irreversible impact of this conduct, every reasonable effort must be made to prevent it from occurring in the first place. In addition to imposing appropriate punishment, criminal penalties offer the most potential for deterrence.</p>
    <li>Won't this mean many teenages will have criminal records?</li>
          <p>Teenagers are capable of committing all sorts of crimes, including murder and rape. While society may be inclined to exercise leniency in some individual cases involving young defendants, laws against rape and murder are not thrown out or rewritten simply because it is possible that teenagers may commit these crimes.</p>
        <li>Aren't victims to blame for taking intimate pictures of themselves?</li>
          <p>Victims who do make intimate images available to an intimate partner have entrusted another person with sensitive information. This is no different from customers giving their credit cards to waiters, or patients giving their sensitive health information to doctors. Waiters and doctors who abuse this private information by giving it to unauthorized individuals face criminal penalties. Private sexual information deserves no less protection than private financial or health information.</p>
        <li>What is the current status of criminal laws against revenge porn?</li>
          <p>Before 2013, only three U.S. states – New Jersey, Alaska, and Texas – had criminal laws directly applicable to nonconsensual pornography. Since 2013, 32 states have passed criminal legislation to address this conduct: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas (to supplement previous law) Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, bringing the total number of states with “revenge porn” laws as of June 7, 2016, to 34, along with Washington, D.C. The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative has been working with the office of Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-CA) on a federal bill addressing the issue, tentatively titled the Intimate Privacy Protection Act. It will be introduced in June 2016.</p>
