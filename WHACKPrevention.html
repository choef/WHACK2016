<h2> In the age of "the cloud", powerful search engines, and extensive online social-networks...</h2>
  <p> Revenge is an all too possible reality for many. The risks are high. Intimate, personal, and compromising pictures and videos can be easily found and shared online only to be discovered by family members, romantic partners, co-wrokers, and clients that can often result in the tragic loss of trust and reputation. While it is ABSOLUTELY the fault of the perpetrator(s), it is a good idea to take some steps to prevent this gross crime from happening to friends,loved ones, and yourself. With your safety in mind, we have compiled a list that will , hopefully, be helpful. </p>

  <div class="column-halfr"><h2> Top 5 Suggestions to Safety and Prevention:</h2>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> If you do take intimate and compromising pictures of yourself avoid uploading them to services that require "the cloud". Doing so compromises your privacy in the hands of systems that are hackable. </li>
      <br><li> Avoid sharing these pictures at all - even people that you trust. Why? because even if they claim to be trust-worthy now, this will not prevent harmful actions taken by disgruntled ex-partners or ex-friends in the future. Another reason is that you can never prevent THEIR devices, passwords, or accounts from being stolen and used to cause harm.</li>
      <br><li> Be cautious of photographers or '(con)artists' who approach you to model for them in public or on social media platforms. Ex. Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Check their credentials. Google them and their work. </li>
      <br><li> If you are aware that someone is in possession of your intimate media, be firm in your request for them to delete it. Immediately. Let them know that Saftey and Prevention is a serious priority for you. If they decline, let them know that refusal is illegal and that you are aware of your cyber rights. Document their non-complicity should this have to gbe taken further.

      <br><li> The simplest way to prevent this is to never take or share these private moments at all. </li>
