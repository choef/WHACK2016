<h1> In the age of "the cloud", powerful search engines, and extensive online social-networks...</h1>
<p>
<h3> Revenge is an all too possible reality for many. The risks are high. Intimate, personal, and compromising
pictures and videos can be  easily found and shared online only to be family members, romantic partners, co-wrokers, and clients that can
often result in the tragic loss of trust and reputation.  While it is ABSOLUTELY the fault of the perpetrator(s), it is a good idea
to take some steps from this gross crime from happening to friends,loved ones, and yourself. With your safety in mind,
we have compiled a list that will ,hopefully, be helpful. </h3>
<h2> Top 5 Suggestions to Safety and Prevention:</h2>
<h3>
<ol>
   <li> If you do take intimate and compromising pictures of yourself avoid uploading them to services that require
     "the cloud". Doing so compromises your privacy in the hands of systems that are hackable. </li>
   <li> Avoid sharing these pictures at all -even people that you trust. Why? because even if they claim to be trust-worthy,
     this will not prevent harmful actions taken by disgruntled ex-partners or friends. Another reason,
      You can never prevent THEIR devices, passwords, or accounts from being stolen and used to cause harm.</li>
   <li> Be cautious about photographers or '(con)artists' who approach you to model for them in public or on socia media platforms. Ex. Intstagram, Facebook,
     Snapchat, etc. Check their credentials. Google them and their work. </li>
   <li> If you are aware that someone is in possession of your intimate media be firm in your request for them to delete it. Immediately.
     Let them know that Saftey and Prevention is a serious priority for you. If they decline, let them know that refusal is illegal
     and that you are aware of your cyber rights. Document their non-complicity should this have to go further.
